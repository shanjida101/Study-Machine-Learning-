This project is a demo on the end-to-end machine learning workflow where I applied  the **understanding I have personally developed and learned** to train a predictive model. It is a **learning and testing-oriented project** where my aim was to build the project on my practical understanding of machine learning concepts.

### üîÅ Project Workflow:
 **Step 1:** Data Collection & Loading  
 **Step 2:** Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
 **Step 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
 **Step 4:** Model Selection and Training  
 **Step 5:** Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)  
 **Step 6:** Model Deployment or Visualization of Results
  
 üìå I followed this video as a learning reference.
