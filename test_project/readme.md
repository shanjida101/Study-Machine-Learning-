This project showcases an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline where I applied my **own understanding and self-learned knowledge** to build and train a model. I followed a video tutorial for guidance but made sure to implement everything in my **own way**, including the workflow design, code, and explanation.

 ðŸ“Œ I followed this video as a learning reference, but the code, structure, and understanding are entirely based on my own implementation and learning process.
