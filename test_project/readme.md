This project showcases an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow where I applied my **own understanding and self-learned knowledge** to build and train a predictive model. It is primarily a **learning and testing-based project** undertaken to strengthen my practical understanding of ML concepts.

While I referred to a video tutorial for overall guidance, all the implementation including the **code, workflow structure, data handling, and explanations** â€” was done in my **own way**, based on what Iâ€™ve learned through self-study.
